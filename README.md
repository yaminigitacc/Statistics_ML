Descriptive Statistics: 
The descriptive statistics are four parts.

1.Measure of central tendancy:
Mean , Median, Mode.
Mean is nothing but average of data
Median is n+1/2
Mode : The highest frequency of number is called Mode.(Nothing but no. of repetiotions.


2.Measure of asymmetry:
Skewness: +ve = data on left side outliers on right side where  mean > median and mode.
          -ve = data on right side outliers on left side where mode > mean and median.
          0 skew = Gaussian distribution or nomal distribution where mean = median = mode.

Kurtois:   The curtios are same as skewness but the graphs are tailed.
          +ve kurtios (leptoykurtic) : the data will be like +ve skew > 3
          -ve kurtois (platykurctic) : the data will be line -ve skew < 3
          0 kurtic (messo kurtic) : the data will be like normal distribution = 3.

Both skewness and kurtois are same statistical measures of distributions but they have different purposes.


3.Measure of variablity:
Variance : the data spread towards mean  
Statndard Deviation: Square root of population variation(sigma), square root of sample variation(s)
Coefficient of variations: std/mean

Measure of relationship: 
Nothing but covariance .It is relationship between two attributes.
In EDA we call it as corelation but it is covariance.
